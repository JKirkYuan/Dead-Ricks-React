## List of Dead Ricks

- I've been diving head first in React+Redux. I got bored and wanted to test myself to see if I'm able to create a very basic app that makes an API call to [RickMortyAPI](https://rickandmortyapi.com) and render all the names onto a page

### Completed Features

- An active to see which Rick is currently being displayed ✅
- I really want to implement a next page feature that allows you to see all the different dead Ricks. I'm currently just pulling them from a single page ✅
- No more CSS! Everything styled-component! ✅
- Pictures & Species & Location & Episode appearance! ✅

### TODO

- CSSGRID! BEGONE BOOTSTRAP
- TONS OF STYLING
- JEST TESTING
