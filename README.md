## List of Dead Ricks

- I've been diving head first in React+Redux. I got bored and wanted to test myself to see if I'm able to create a very basic app that makes an API call to [RickMortyAPI](https://rickandmortyapi.com) and render all the names onto a page

### Features to add

- Also an active to see which Rick is currently being displayed
- I really want to implement a next page feature that allows you to see all the different dead Ricks. I'm currently just pulling them from a single page
